		Batch #6 - All Grain #2 (05-02-10)

<p>
The <a href="http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/">American Homebrewers Association</a> celebrates National Homebrew Day with an event called <a href="http://www.homebrewersassociation.org/pages/events/national-homebrew-day">Big Brew</a>. It is held on the first Saturday of May each year.  The idea is that you get a group together and everyone around the world who is participating brews at the same time. The AHA has a section of their site dedicated to tracking participants and the overall results of the event. They also provide a set of recipes to choose from so that everyone is brewing the same thing.

		Batch #5 - All Grain #1.

Brewed: 04-04-10

<p>
This is my first all grain batch and my second to be kegged.   I begin my recipe search as I most often do - by browsing the recipe database at <a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/">HBT</a>.  Once again, I know I&#8217;m going to go with a recipe in a style I haven&#8217;t done before.  This time I am picking the Scotch Ale style, a strong ale with a strong smoky malt profile.  <a href="http://www.moylans.com/pages/brewery/beers.htm">Moylan&#8217;s Kilt Lifter</a> is one commercial example of the style.  After a bit of searching, I have chosen my base to be a recipe going by the name of <a href="http://www.homebrewtalk.com/f65/if-its-not-scottish-its-crap-33739/">&#8220;If It&#8217;s Not Scottish, It&#8217;s Crap&#8221;</a>.  While the reference to the Mike Meyers classic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108174/">&#8220;So I Married An Axe Murderer&#8221;</a> is a strong consideration in my choice, ultimately it is the distinctive technique and unique hops selection used in this particular recipe that draw me to my final decision.

		This is batch #3. 

<p>
My goal with each new batch of beer is to do something I&#8217;ve never done before. I use this experimentation as a way explore and learn about the world of beer and brewing. There are usually several new things that I introduce each time I brew, but overall I try to limit the variables to a small extent in order to help me understand the role that each one plays. In this case, I&#8217;m trying out a new style. Also, I&#8217;m working with both LME and DME in a single batch. While I&#8217;ve worked with each on their own, I&#8217;ve never combined them. It shouldn&#8217;t really be a big difference, but it&#8217;s still a new variable.

			Valentine&#8217;s Edition Brew Day - Bell&#8217;s Two Hearted Ale</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>
So, technically, the brew was on the day after Valentine&#8217;s Day (or as it is affectionately known around the house since it coincides with the Chinese New Year, Loony FatChoyintine&#8217;s Day). The ingredients were sourced on the most special of holidays, though.
</p>

<p>
Bell&#8217;s Two Hearted Ale is an IPA brewed by <a href="http://www.bellsbeer.com/home">Bell&#8217;s</a> out of Kalamazoo, Michigan. Unfortunately, it isn&#8217;t available on the west coast. My first introduction to it was through a visit to the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/patton-alley-pub-springfield">Patton Alley Pub</a> during my vacation back home in Springfield, Missouri. It&#8217;s a straightforward dry-hopped IPA brewed with all Centennial hops. Having enjoyed my sampling and not having any access to it back home, I decided to attempt a clone. After a quick bit of Google research, I had a base extract recipe and shopping list.

These are hands down, the best wings I&#8217;ve ever made. Never mind that the recipe was hastily hacked together from multiple online recipe sources and only used as a rough guideline once in the kitchen. And don&#8217;t even think of bringing up the fact that I&#8217;m basing this on a sample size of one and have never actually made hot wings before. Caveats in mind, here it is.

			The Belgian Blonde</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>
This is my second batch of craft home brewed beer. When I set out to pick the recipe this time around I had several goals in mind.  Based on my experiences the first time, I knew I wanted to expand on the knowledge and techniques I had used so far. It needed to be an even bigger beer. Instead of using dry yeast it had to be a liquid variety and use a proper starter. I wanted to try a dry extract using the late addition method rather than the standard liquid schedule. Lastly, it had to be a different style.
</p>

<p>
After much contemplation and searching on various home brew recipe sites, I eventually settled on a Belgian golden strong ale known as &#8220;Blonde Bombshell.&#8221; Weighing in at around 8.3% ABV, it&#8217;s a surprisingly straightforward ingredient list that leads to a big favorful Belgian style beer.

My homebrew adventure began with a trip to the local supply shop, <a href="http://www.sanfranciscobrewcraft.com/">San Francisco Brewcraft</a>. 
After a few weeks of internet research I had a pretty good idea of what I needed to get started. Most of the necessary equipment is typically 
packaged up into custom kits sold by just about every brewing store around. I settled on a mid-range kit composed of a 6.5 gallon plastic primary fermenting bucket (with spigot), 5 gallon glass carboy secondary fermenter, stoppers, airlocks, cleaning brushes, hose, funnel, bottle caps and capper, auto-siphon, hydrometer, and the ingredients for the first batch of beer. I threw in a 5 gallon brew kettle and no-rinse sanitizer and was on my way to get started cooking.
