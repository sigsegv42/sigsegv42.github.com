			Electric Brewery Upgrade - Part 1</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>
	It&#8217;s closing in on two years now since the last blog update.  Even though I haven&#8217;t been keeping content updated, I&#8217;ve still been busy brewing.  Maybe a future post will spend a bit more time reflecting on all of those brews.  That is not this post.  This post is all about the new pilot brewing system I built over the past winter.

I made my <a href="/blog/2011/02/12/the-commoner/">first steam beer</a> about six months ago.  It was my first brew of the year (not counting mead) and my first attempt at coming up with my own recipe.  While there were a number of milestones that came with that brew, I wasn&#8217;t all that thrilled with the resulting beer.  It wasn&#8217;t bad, but try as I might, I just could never find anything particularly noteworthy about it.

		<p>
The brewing process for me often starts with a simple concept or core thematic element.  It could be an ingredient, a style, or some other idea serving as the inspiration for the beer.  In this case a recent thread in the HBT forums brought up the idea of an end of the world brew.
</p>

<p>
According to some interpretations of the Mayan calendar the world is set to end on December, 23rd 2012.  This would be a perfect opportunity for a commemorative beer to celebrate the occasion.  Following along with the forum thread, I&#8217;d start with an imperial stout and then age it with chile peppers and cacao nibs.

		<p>
It&#8217;s been over a year since I&#8217;ve brewed something falling into the Belgian style category.  
My last attempt was a golden strong ale called <a href="http://itenerancy.com/blog/2009/12/22/the-belgian-blonde/">Blonde Bombshell</a>. 
It was also my second brewing experience ever.  In the intervening time my knowledge and process has changed significantly.  
I&#8217;ve gone from brewing partial-boil extract recipes taken from the internet to all-grain full-boil batches created from my own custom designed recipes.  Regardless my advances, I&#8217;m always finding areas of my techniques and processes to improve upon from one session to the next.

		<p>
As I&#8217;ve slowly worked my way through various new styles and ingredients to experiment with, fruit has long been on my list. I&#8217;ve been looking forward to making a beer featuring cherries for nearly a year now.  The idea first came to me after seeing fresh ripe cherries at a local farmers market one weekend.  Unfortunately, it was already late in the season and by the time I was finally ready the opportunity for market fresh cherries had passed.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to the following spring and I would be prepared for the next harvest.  I had a recipe ready and had all of the ingredients on hand ahead of time.  As soon as I began to see cherries at the farmers markets this year I knew it was finally time.

		Batch #12 - All Grain #7

<p>
One of my favorite batches to date has been my <a href="http://itenerancy.com/blog/2010/09/22/scottish-zombie-jesus/">Strong Scotch Ale all-grain recipe</a>.  One of the signature characteristics of most Scottish ales is a deep, rich malt profile.  The flavors often a result of early century procedures producing kettle-scortched wort, modern day recreations are created from the caramelized reduction of the first runnings which is added back in with the rest of the wort at the end of the boil.  
</p>

<p>
I&#8217;m revisiting the Scottish Ale style category, this time with a version of a Scottish Export / 80 Shilling Ale.  As a last minute decision I&#8217;m also going to attempt another parti-gyle.  My goal is an additional 3 gallon batch for my spare small carboy.  This smaller variant will ultimately be destined for my new 10L (2.64 gallon) oak barrel.  Hopefully this one will fare better than my last double batch attempt.

		Batch #11 - All Grain #6

<p>
I&#8217;m kicking off the 2011 brewing season with what I had anticipated on being my last brew of 2010.  I was hoping to get this brew in before the end of the year.  Unfortunately, an order shipment delay from <a href="http://www.morebeer.com">MoreBeer</a> followed by a month long chest cold and a grain mill debacle added up to a two month brewing hiatus.
</p>

<p>
Instead of my usual internet recipe search, I&#8217;ve decided to take another big step and develop my own recipe.  I began planning this recipe early in December with daily high temperatures temperatures in the low 50&#8217;s and the thermostat in the house reading 57-59&deg;F each morning.  The cooler weather seemed perfect for trying out White Labsâ€™ San Francisco Lager yeast.  This is a lager yeast which ferments at the lower end of the ale temperature range (58-65&deg;).  Using Ray Daniels&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Great-Beers-Ultimate-Brewing/dp/0937381500/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1297132023&sr=8-1">Designing Great Beers</a> and my copy of <a href="http://beersmith.com/">BeerSmith</a> as guides, I came up with a what I hope is a suitable California Common style recipe.

I&#8217;ve been wanting to branch out from beer and try my hand at brewing mead for quite a while.  Other than the suggestion that a fermented alcoholic beverage made from honey and fruit sounds delicious, I really don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m getting into.  Given that I&#8217;m in completely unknown territory here, I really don&#8217;t want to commit to a full 5 gallon batch of something I might end up not liking.  Fortunately, it turns out that a lot of mead recipes are formulated in smaller 3 gallon batch sizes.

		Batch #9 - All Grain #5

<p>
It&#8217;s time for a new recipe and all new mistakes.  This is batch #2 on my v3.0 brewing system - ninth overall since I started home brewing and the fifth all-grain.  This time around I&#8217;m finally tackling something that I&#8217;ve been wanting to do for almost as long as I&#8217;ve been brewing.  It&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve come to call the &#8220;Vertical Epic&#8221; named after a series of beers created by Stone Brewing Co.  In their model, each beer is released on that year&#8217;s palindrome date (e.g. 10-10-10, 11-11-11, 12-12-12) and meant to be cellared for at least one year after the brew date before drinking.  The original concept comes from the wine world and vertical tastings where similar wines from multiple vintages are sampled in a single sitting in order to compare and contrast the differences between the chosen bottles.

			Back Yard Shambling</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>
It&#8217;s been a few months since my last brew.  Since then, I&#8217;ve moved into a new apartment (to be closer to my brewing assistant, of course).  While I still have the kitchen space and stove capacity to do my brewing inside, I&#8217;ve decided to move my brewing out of the kitchen and into the back yard.  This means yet another round of upgrades to my equipment - and one of the biggest investments in new gear to date.
</p>

<p>
This is my second major brewhouse upgrade.  The first upgrade included an MLT and larger brew kettle, allowing me to move into the world of al-grain brewing.  With that also came an extra 2-3 hours devoted to each brewing session.  Part of this is due to required mash time that can&#8217;t be factored out, but I know there are some other time inefficiencies in my process that I can fix.  With this in mind, my goal for this set of upgrades is to address some of these issues and to begin automating some of my processes.  Hopefully some of these changes will eventually lead to better recipe reproducibility and ultimately a better finished product.
