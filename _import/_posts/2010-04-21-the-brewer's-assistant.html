The art of brewing should by no means be a solitary hobby. In fact, an extra pair of hands often comes in very handy. The right hand to the brew master is the brewer's assistant. I've somehow managed to coerce Jennie into helping me at every step of the way in my developing hobby. Jennie hates beer.
