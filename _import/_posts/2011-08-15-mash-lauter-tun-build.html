The mash lauter tun is a vessel used for in the all grain brewing process.  The name refers to two steps in the brewing process.  Mashing refers to the process of combining and heating grains and water in order to break down the starches into sugar compounds.  Lautering is the process of separating the clear liquid wort from this soaked grain mixture.  In larger operations, there may be separate mash and lauter tuns.  Smaller home brewing setups can use a single container for both purposes.

The key to a MLT vessel is the ability to maintain a steady temperature.  Some advanced designs may use temperature gauges and active heating elements to monitor and actively control the mash temperature.  A much simpler DIY approach is to convert a cheap picnic cooler.  The same insulation which keeps things cool can also work to keep hot things hot.  A round 10 gallon water cooler works perfectly for most 5 gallon brews, accommodating larger grain bills hitting the 20 pound mark.  This is the same large orange container found on the sideline of any sporting event or the back of construction vehicles and is readily available from your local hardware store.  While I've chosen to use the round cooler design, rectangular picnic coolers of similar capacity work equally as well.

The second key component is the manifold.  The purpose of the manifold is to promote the flow of the wort from the container after the mash.  There is a lot of science behind the flow of hot liquid through different grain beds and the affect of various manifold designs.  Luckily, it isn't necessary to delve into the math behind the thermodynamics in order to build a successful manifold.  Of course, if you are interested, John Palmer, et al have written in detail on the topic. 

When it comes to manifold design, the most common is a grid of copper tubing with slits cut along its length.  This is a proven design which works especially well for rectangular coolers.

The cooler is not sufficient for brewing on its own.  This model comes with a standard plastic push button spigot design.  Pressing a button continuously in order to drain 5+ gallons of liquid from the tun is definitely not ideal.  Luckily, it can easily be removed and replaced with a brass ball valve assembly.
