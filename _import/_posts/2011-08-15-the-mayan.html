Brewing often follows a theme.  It could be an ingredient, a style, or some other concept serving as the inspiration for your brew.  A recent thread in the HBT forums brought up the idea of an end of the world brew.  According to some interpretations of the Mayan calendar the world is set to end on December, 23rd 2012.  This is a perfect time for a commemorative beer celebrating the occasion.  Following along with the forum thread, I'm starting with an imperial stout and then aging it with chile peppers and cacao nibs.  

This is the biggest brew I've done to date.  I'll be mashing 24 pounds of grain with 7 gallons of water, pushing the limits of my mash tun.  Since this is such a large beer I'm going to try another partigyle.  My goal is to collect enough final runnings for a 2.5 gallon batch of porter.  The primary batch should have a target original gravity of around 1.110 while the small batch should start around 1.045.

I was able to plan ahead of enough to create a yeast starter the day before.  This would be a busy brew day.  Not only did I have two boils planned, I also had two batches that needed to be transferred in order to make room for this new set.  The Gun Stock Ale needed to be racked off the oak cubes had been aging in it for the last few months.  The Belgian also needed to be transfered into a secondary fermenter.  

As luck would have it, I once again ran out of propane partway through.  This time it caught me as I was heating the initial strike water.  Once again, Jennie saved the day helping exchange my empty tank for a full bottle.

<h4>Rapture</h4>

The secondary phase is where this recipe begins to take a significant divergence from the original.  I start by roasting two habanero peppers over an open flame on the stove. Next, I chop the peppers up into eighths, discarding the stems.  I slice up a dried guajillo peppers into similar sized pieces.  I add these into a pan with about a cup of water - just enough to cover the peppers.  Finally, I bring the mixture of water and peppers to a boil and simmer for a few minutes.  This accomplishes two things. First, it re-hydrates the dried peppers.  Secondly, it sterilizes the peppers, reducing the risk of infection after adding them to the already fermenting beer.

Finally, the peppers and water are dumped into the bucket along with 3 ounces of roasted cacao nibs.  The beer is then racked on top of this.  Since I'm hoping to bulk age this brew, I also decide to include an additional dry hopping with another half ounce of whole Willamette hops.  I want this beer to still have some of its hoppy character after it's been in a bottle for a year.  I'm hoping that this last hop addition will push it over the finish line.

<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>

I've tried partigyles several times before.  The concept is always the same - make a smaller beer from grains of a bigger beer.  Success is dependent on a few factors beyond the first batch.
