It's a new year and I've started to reflect back on the past year and think ahead to what's in store for the next year in my homebrewing "career".  2010 marked my first full year of brewing my own beer.  I've been careful to keep around a few bottles of some of my very first brews, now over a year old.  There's only a couple left from those batches and I save them for very special occasions.  It's really great to open one up to celebrate, reflect back on the past and marvel at how the flavor of each one has changed over time.  I still find the bottles of my very first extract brew, the Kalakalaky IPA to be quite mixed with occasional green apple notes still apparent in some tastings.  My second brew, the Belgian Golden Strong Ale has only gotten better over time.  The Edmund Fitzgerald Porter clone is a reminder of how seemingly fatal brewing flaws can still turn out a decent beer.

In 2010, I had a few goals:
<h4> 2010 Goals</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Brew 12 batches</li>
  <li>Move to all-grain brewing</li>
  <li>Build a keezer</li>
  <li>Start kegging beer</li>
</ul>

My original goal was to brew at least one batch per month on average, ending up with 12 batches overall.  Measuring in 5 gallon batches, that would be 60 gallons in total for the entire year.  By the end of the year I only managed 30 gallons or 6 batches - half of my original goal.  Of course, itt was a lofty goal that I didn't realistically expect to achieve.  It was still worthwhile to try to accomplish.  Looking back, even coming in half short I'm more than pleased with my production.  Going forward in 2011, I'm going to keep the same 12 batch/60 gallon goal.  I'm not sure if it is any more realistic this year than it was this year.  I think it will be more doable since I've started improving my planning and ingredient sourcing processes.  I'm now planning several batches ahead and stocking bulk grains to have on hand for multiple upcoming brews.

I also had several goals requiring significant equipment investments.  First, I wanted to transition from extract and partial mash brewing into all-grain brewing.  This meant buying a larger brew kettle and building a MLT from a cooler and additional parts.  Next, I wanted to start kegging beer instead of bottling it.  I had to buy the kegs plus a freezer to store them in along with all of the necessary faucet and plumbing hardware in order to convert it into a keg freezer (keezer).


<h4>2011 Goals</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Brew 12 batches / 60 gallons</li>
  <li>Expand keezer to 3 taps</li>
  <li>Brew a batch of mead</li>
  <li>Bottle from kegs</li>
  <li>Small batch experimental & SMaSH style brewing</li>
  <li>Co-create new brand labels</li>
  <li>Collect wild yeast & brew with it</li>
  <li>Start a yeast bank</li>
  <li>Grow my own hops</li>
  <li>Mill my own grains</li>
  <li>Barrel age beer</li>
  <li>Sample more commercial styles</li>
</ul>

While a lot of my goals for the previous year were centered around equipment and process, I don't have a lot of radical new equipment upgrades planned going forward this year.  Instead I'm looking at focusing more on the diversity of brewing styles with more experimentation with different yeast strains and exploring how individual grain and hop varieties contribute to overall flavor profiles.  

This doesn't mean I don't have a healthy budget for new equipment planned out.  So far, I've already invested in a <a href="http://www.monsterbrewinghardware.com/mm-2.html">Monster Mill</a> in order to satisfy my goal of milling my own grains.  I've also purchased a <a href="http://barrelsonline.com/">10 liter (2.64 gallon) oak barrel</a> that I'll be able to use for experiment with barrel aging, a counterpressure bottle filler for transferring from keg to bottle, and a yeast stir plate.  I'll also probably be picking up additional faucets and plumbing hardware for extending my keezer at some point.  I'd also like to invest in another keg or two, and perhaps additional carboys as I expand my production pipeline.  There are a few other gadgets I have in mind such as a pH meter and water purifier system for helping me understand and improve my water chemistry.

As I explore the brewing world and the various style definitions, there are a number of less traditional brews I want to try out.  I'm curious about sour and wild brews, other fermented beverages such as mead, cider, and tepache.  I also want to learn more about the contribution of individual malt and hop profiles with SMaSH (Single Malt and Single Hop) recipes.  Many of these experimental brews will probably take the form of smaller 1-3 gallon sized batches.  Hopefully this will allow me to lower my investment in what may end up being potential drain pours while giving me the space to do more of them.

<h4>Production Schedule</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Razzmatazz - 3 gallon Raspberry Melomel (Mead)</li>
  <li>The Commoner - 5 gallon California Common</li>
  <li>Shill For Hire - 5 gallon Scottish Export 80/-</li>
  <li>Little Shill - 3 gallon Scottish Light 60/-</li>
  <li>Vienna/Simcoe SMaSH - 3 gallon APA</li>
  <li>FreightHopper - 5 gallon IPA</li>
  <li>12-21-12 Mayan Apocalypse - 5 gallon Imperial Stout</li>
  <li>The Belgian - 5 gallon Belgian Dark Strong Ale</li>
  <li>Cherry - 5 gallon Fruit Beer</li>
  <li>Tepache - 1 gallon pineapple wine</li>
  
</ol>


<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>

As the first quarter of the year draws near an end, how far have I come to accomplishing any of these goals?  With my Monster Mill acquisition, I'm now successfully crushing all of my grain bills myself.  My first batch of mead is now a few months into its aging process.  It may still be at least a few more months until I have any idea if it is any good or not.  My small barrel is leak tested and ready for its first good beer to go in for barrel aging.  I have a counter-pressure bottle filler on hand to begin filling up bottles from my kegs.  Two out of the 12 targeted batches have been brewed and kegged.  All of the additional hardware to expand the taps on the keezer has been ordered.
