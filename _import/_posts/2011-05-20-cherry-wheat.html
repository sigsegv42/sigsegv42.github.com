I don't have a lot to say about this one.  I've been wanting to do a beer featuring cherries for almost a year now.  The idea first came to me after seeing the cherries at a local farmers market.  However, it was already late in the season and by the time I finally committed to the notion I had missed my opportunity.  Fast forward to the following spring and I would be prepared for the next harvest.  I had come up with a recipe and had all of the ingredients on hand ahead of time.  As soon as I began to see cherries at the farmers markets this year I knew it was time.

My recipe's grain bill is pretty straightforward, consisting of almost equal parts 2 row and white wheat malts plus a small percentage of light crystal malt.  For hops, I initially chose Tettnang.  However, these being more difficult to procure I fell back on the more readily available Czech Saaz.  Fashionably late as usual, I prepped a liter yeast starter on the morning of the brew day, offering the yeast only about a six hour head start.

This session was not without its own share of mistakes.  Instead of boiling down to the final volume that I needed, I used whatever volume I had after an hour boil.  This was partly due to the wind blowing out the flame on my burner at the 60 minute mark.  Not wanting to waste leaving the excess behind in the kettle, my carboy was nearly topped off with wort.  When it came time to pitch the starter, less than half of the flask contents managed to fill the carboy the rest of the way up.  I was fully committed to the endeavor at this point with no backing out and just a little bit of morbid curiosity as to what sort of mess I was in for.  I went ahead and fitted in a stopper and blow off tube routed into a large plastic pitcher with a bit of star san in it.  If fermentation hadn't gotten started by the following morning or things were getting out of hand I could just siphon a bit of the excess out and pitch the remaining starter.  Fortunately, the yeast did its job and the tube held, routing about a half gallon of blow off into the pitcher.  Once the most vigorous fermentation had slowed a few days later and with enough head room I was able to safely replace the hose with an airlock.

In a week, I'll stock up on the cherries that will go into the secondary container.  I ended up having to buy a new 6 gallon bucket to use for secondary with this batch.  I had just moved my apocalyptic stout into my only bucket and I had just the one carboy free.  Even my kegs were all full. This batch would completely fill my pipeline up and I would have nowhere to transfer it for the secondary phase.  While an impromptu order placed with MoreBeer was a quick and easy fix to the situation at hand, it remains a valuable lesson in the proper capacity planning of the beer pipeline.
