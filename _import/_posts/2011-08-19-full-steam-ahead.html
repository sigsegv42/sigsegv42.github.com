My first steam beer attempt was about six months ago.  It was my first brew of the year (not counting mead) and my first attempt at coming up with my own recipe.  While there were a number of milestones that came with that brew, I wasn't all that thrilled with the resulting beer.  It wasn't bad, but try as I might, I just could never find anything particularly noteworthy about it.

Now, six months and six brews later, I've decided to revisit my original recipe and try again.  I'm not just going to try the same recipe all over again, I'll be making some adjustments to the recipe itself.  This time I'm omitting the biscuit malt from the grain bill and redistributing the percentages of Munich and crystal malts.  The hops will also get some small changes.  While my original plan was to keep with Willamette as a finishing hop, when it came to brew day it turned out that my inventory was out of sync.  I had no Willamette on hand and decided to substitute Cascade as an aroma addition.

The only other aspect that I've changed since my last brew is to upgrade the bulkhead and valve components of my mash tun.  My original components had begun to show some signs of discoloration and I was starting to worry about the possibility of their negative flavor contributions.  I've decided to replace part of the brass and rubber components.  The bulkhead will be replaced with a solid plastic piece with matching plastic nut and rubber washer. The fittings adjacent to either side of the new bulkhead as well as the valve assembly will all be replaced with stainless steel components.  All of these components are 1/2" instead of the original 3/8".
