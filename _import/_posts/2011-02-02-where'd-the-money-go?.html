I admit it.  I have a problem.  I keep sinking money into new homebrewing equipment.  Simple stovetop extract brewing wasn't enough.  I needed more equipment for all-grain brewing.  Bottling was too much work.  I needed to start kegging.  The kegs need a cooling and draught serving system.  The list seems to go on forever.  Almost every time I go to brew it seems like I want to add more new equipment.  It's hard to know where to stop.

One of the promises early in your homebrewing career is the notion that you'll save money brewing your own beer versus buying beer from the store.  It's certainly possible to brew on a budget and save money in the process.  However, any hobby can quickly turn into a budget swelling obsession.  As it turns out, for a certain large percentage, the hobby is more about enjoying the craft than it ever is about saving money.  This has been my case as I've progressed through my various brewing phases.

So, what does a bottle of beer cost me these days?  I started homebrewing around a year and a half ago.  In that amount of time I've managed to rack up around two thousand dollars in equipment costs.  This includes everything from basic brewing and fermentation equipment, to kegging and draught serving components, and advanced automation addons.  In comparison, my bill on ingredients is only a fraction of this, adding up to only a few hundred dollars.  Adding up every batch, I've produced around 50 gallons of beer in my brewing career.  The quick calculations work out to around $3 per bottle of beer.  This is definitely more expensive than bringing commercial beer home from the store and barely better than going out to the bar.

Will I ever get to a point where my price per pint becomes 'profitable'?  I definitely think it's possible.  At least, I certainly think my production costs will eventually begin to lower.  As I brew more and invest in less equipment I'll slowly begin to absorb some of these initial equipment costs.  For now, there's some light at the end of the tunnel.  That is, until I decide I want to go all electric, move to 10 gallon batches, or any other radical process shifts that would require more costly equipment investments.
