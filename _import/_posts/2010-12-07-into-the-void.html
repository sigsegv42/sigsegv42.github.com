I admit it.  I have a secret guilty pleasure.  It's Guy Fieri.  Actually, there's something about his TV personality that really bugs me.  No matter how much his poser hipster persona gets to me I continue to get drawn into his show, Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  I'm hooked on the whole concept, really.  It's working class artisans cooking delicious food for the rest of the working class.  These chefs aren't your snooty five star Micheline certified geniuses, but their creations are no less amazing.  So, I'm hooked.

 I should back up a little bit.  When it came to deciding what I wanted to be when I grew up, it turned out I was good at telling computers what to do.  So, I did that.  Programming wasn't the only thing I imagined myself doing.  I often joke that my other career choice would have been as a chef.  I put in my share of time in my formative teenage years working in kitchens, busing tables, washing dishes and flipping burgers.  Even if I don't have any particular raw talent for cooking, I have a natural curiosity for exploring the depths of culinary achievement.

We often find ourselves imagining a different future life.  Having hit the jackpot and won untold millions playing the lottery, we've quit our day jobs and retired early.  We dream of where we'll live and what we'll do with our time.  We'll have a yard with a big garden where we'll grow much of our food.  I'll brew my beer and serve it in our brew pub.  We imagine the ingredients we would grow and what dishes we might cook up.  It's the kind of place I imagine Guy would fawn over and that friends would love.

So here I am imagining what the menu of this fictional establishment would look like.  I dream of the styles of beer I would brew and serve on tap.  This is where my blogging comes in.  I've already been blogging my brewing activities.  Each new beer recipe ends in a blog post which both describes the process and reflects on the lessons learned throughout.  Why not apply the same concept towards the formulation of a potential pub menu?

This is my new year's project.  I'll develop a full pub menu.  The process will be written up in blog form, fully photographed and kitchen tested.  Food and beer recipes will be carefully designed and executed.  No matter how carefully, there will be mistakes.  I'll write it up and present it warts and all.
