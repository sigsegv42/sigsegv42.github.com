A rehash of the classic. Simple 2D graphics using OpenGL and sound effects via OpenAL. Supports 2 player Co-op and single player versus AI game play modes. It began as a simple project to implement a completely finished and working game utilizing modern C++. Since the completion of the working prototype, it has slowly become a test application for a growing set of common framework libraries.
