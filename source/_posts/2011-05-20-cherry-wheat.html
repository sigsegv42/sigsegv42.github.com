As I've slowly worked my way through various new styles and ingredients to experiment with, fruit has long been on my list. I've been looking forward to 
making a beer featuring cherries for nearly a year now.  The idea first came to me after seeing fresh ripe cherries at a local farmers market one weekend.  
Unfortunately, it was already late in the season and by the time I was finally ready I had missed my opportunity. The window for farm fresh cherries was much 
too short for my slow planning.  
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to the following spring and I would be prepared for the next harvest.  I had a recipe ready and had all of the 
ingredients on hand ahead of time.  As soon as I began to see cherries at the farmers markets this year I knew it was finally time.
</p>

<p>
I chose a straightforward grain bill, consisting of a nearly 50/50 split of 2 row and white wheat malts plus a small percentage of light crystal malt.  
For hops, I initially chose Tettnang.  However, these being more difficult to procure I fell back on the more readily available Czech Saaz.  Fashionably late 
as usual, I prepped a liter yeast starter on the morning of the brew day, offering the yeast only about a six hour head start.  It wouldn't be doing much to
bolster the cell count, but I hoped it would at least help the yeast ease into the main course.
</p>

<p>
As usual, this session was not without its share of mistakes.  Instead of boiling down to the final volume that I needed, I used whatever volume I had after an hour 
boil.  This was partly due to the wind blowing out the flame on my burner at the 60 minute mark.  Not wanting to waste leaving the excess behind in the kettle, 
my carboy was nearly topped off with wort.  When it came time to pitch the starter, less than half of the flask contents managed to fill the carboy the rest of 
the way up.  I was fully committed to the endeavor at this point with no backing out and just a little bit of morbid curiosity as to what sort of mess I was in 
for.  I went ahead and fitted in a stopper and blow off tube routed into a large plastic pitcher with a bit of star san in it.
</p>

<p>
If fermentation hadn't gotten started by the following morning or things were getting out of hand I could just siphon a bit of the excess out and pitch the remaining 
starter.  Fortunately, the yeast did its job and the tube held, routing about a half gallon of blow off into the pitcher.  Once the most vigorous fermentation had 
slowed a few days later and with enough head room I was able to safely replace the hose with an airlock.
</p>

<p>
In a week, I'll stock up on the cherries that will go into the secondary container.  I ended up having to buy a new 6 gallon bucket to use for secondary with 
this batch.  I had just moved my apocalyptic stout into my only bucket and I had just the one carboy free.  Even my kegs were all full. This batch would 
completely fill my pipeline up and I would have nowhere to transfer it for the secondary phase.  While an impromptu order placed with MoreBeer was a quick 
and easy fix to the situation at hand, it remains a valuable lesson in the proper capacity planning of the beer pipeline.

<h4>Clarification</h4>

<p>
When I transferred to keg, I went straight from the bucket spiggot into the keg.  As a result a lot of cherry pulp made it into the keg.  I treated
the keg with a tablespoon of gelatin boiled in a small amount of water, hoping that the pulp would eventually clear out.  It never really helped.  I
ended up with a nicely carbonated beer with a less than pleasant pulpiness to it.  I still needed a way to filter the beer out.  I found several
filtering options. The two most common approaches seemed to be plate and cylinder filters.  Since I already had a cylindrical filter housing, it
made sense to simply modify my existing setup.  The same housing for filtering water could also be used for filtering beer.  All would just need a 
filter and some additional hose fittings to switch between the existing faucet connections and beer line connections.
</p>

<p>
With some small modifications, I had a filter housing with a set of quick disconnect fittings that allowed me to interchange water faucet connections 
and keg beverage fittings.  The big problem I faced was that beer filtering is meant to be done on uncarbonated beer and here I had a full five gallons
of fully carbonated beer.  
</p>


<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>

<p>
The filtering problems probably had a large impact on the final quality of the beer.  The filtering process has undoubtedly contributed to some 
oxidation effect.  I initially thought that I might have used a little bit too many cherries also.  The cherry could stand to be a little less
prominent.  Bottling and aging has helped to subdue the results a little bit.  I can also imagine a soured version of this recipe.  I'm definitely
looking forward to experimenting with cherries again next season.  In the meantime, I still have a few bottles kept in reserve.
